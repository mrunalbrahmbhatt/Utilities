## 1. TDS to Unicorn
This script will crawl your given folder for .scproj files and generates the 95% of equivalent Unicorn single config file. Afterward, the user can customize the generated config according to their needs if something is not working.

### How to use:

1. .\TDStoUnicorn2.ps1 -ProjectName "ProjectName"  *> Project.Website.Serialization.config
2. Replace "ProjectName" in "Unicorn.ProjectName.Config" file content and name.

### Disclaimer

This script is tested on internal projects only, thus feel free to modify to satisfy your needs. I'm not PowerShell script expert so please ignore my poor scripting. Also, I'm not favoring any tool here.

### Suggestion

Please share your suggestions or if you find the better way to do it @it.mrunal@gmail.com.

Happy Sharing.
